          <p>
            I spent twelve weeks at General Assembly's Software Engineering
            Immersive program. I learned the fundamentals of full-stack web
            development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
            Express, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL. I also learned how to work
            in an agile development environment, how to use Git and GitHub, and
            how to deploy my applications to the web using Heroku.
